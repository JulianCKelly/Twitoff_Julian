This repository showcases a basic FLASK app with routes for displaying HTML and also routes that serve as API endpoints to query a database. Considering recent policy changes earlier this year, a pseudo Tweepy file, not_tweepy, was created in order consume data from a manufactured database. The data queried from this database is stored to the application's database. Using word embeddings, the text data was translated into a numeric representation. After this, a machine learning model was built within a Flask App which can be interacted with via API endpoints.
